I am **Hannah Blackburn**, a prospective quantitative psychology PhD student.

My background is in causal inference, and my current research interests are Bayesian statistics, structural equation modeling, and time series analysis. I am a quant researcher, but am curious how incorporating qualitative data can improve quant processes. I also have a substantive interest in developmental psychology in queer and neurodivergent adolescents and emerging adults.

I am committed to the ideals of open science. I believe research should be accessible to the public, as well as the academy, and that writing clearly for a general audience is a core academic skill. 

I'm a little obsessed with R.

I write the Unofficial Psychologist [blog].
